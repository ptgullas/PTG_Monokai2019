Monokai theme for Visual Studio 2019

I had some issues importing my VS2017 Monokai theme into VS2019, so I recreated it based on [Christopher Frewin's Medium article](https://medium.com/@frewin.christopher/how-to-add-awesome-monokai-colors-for-beautiful-c-development-in-visual-studio-2017-a403a2200c25).

This requires the [Visual Studio Color Theme Designer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-madsk.ColorThemeDesigner)

This does **not** require the Extended Syntax Highlighting extension, as VS2019 now natively supports much of the syntax highlighting offered by that extension. I put in a request to have it support static methods.

Will add screenshots when I get a chance.
